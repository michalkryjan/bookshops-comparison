# bookshops-comparison
App used to gather products' data from popular bookshops' homepages. All data is exported to google sheets worksheet where it can be analyzed and where we can find the best offer of specific product :)

My goal was to write code in as objective way as possible, following SOLID and DRY rules.

### Additional info
I replaced all bookshops names with bookshop#1, bookshop#2, bookshop#3, bookshop#4, bookshop#5 to hide their real names and to protect their reliable statistics in Google Analytics in case if somebody copied my code and started to scrap them often. Normally I don't use namespace like this, but in this special case I had to.

### Used packages / technologies
**Python:** Pandas, Requests, BeautifulSoup4, APScheduler, Gspread, oauth2client<br> 
**Docker**
